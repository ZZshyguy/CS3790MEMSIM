Lab assignment 4
Memory simulator
Memory is implemented as a linked list
The driver.cpp file is just an example used to manipulate the memory class and use the methods/functions.
DOESN’T WORK, code looks fine but there is a dangling pointer somewhere and I couldn’t be bothered to find it.

To compile type:
make

To run type:
./DRIVER
